SPORTS CAR LIGHTING AND TEXTURE SCENE
Two sportscars modeled after the Ferrari Testarossa pass one another on a road with the sea and mountains in the background. This scene uses textures for almost every surface. I did not see any reason to put a texture on the roof of the car or the yellow lines on the pavement. Textures which have been borrowed (under fair use) are given attribution in the Acknowledgements section. All textures for the car body were drawn by me by hand. The windsheilds and windows use a subtle glass texture. The background is a sky cube showcasing a sea and mountain background. My next steps would include adding details to the car, some animation like wheels spinning while the car moves, and storefronts or buildings on one or both sides of the road. Adding reflectivity to the car's surfaces or having a highly reflective glass office building on one side of the road would be great.
